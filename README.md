## Education Pathways Test
I created unit test to ensure the successful operation of the edit course admin feature: https://github.com/ECE444-2022Fall/project-1-web-application-design-education-pathways-group-21-ninjas/blob/docker-prep/Education_Pathways/tests/test_app.py#L46-L75

## Pros of TDD
TDD is a very useful principle in software development. This is because it helps the code become more robust as it helps catch errors and mistakes in the functionality of the code. Additionally, it also helps promote a more modular design of the code and architecture because it allows more efficient testing of the different modules. Furthermore, because of the modularity, the code is easier to maintain since it will require less effort to determine which part of the code contains problems. TDD also makes the development process faster and time efficient because of the time saved from manually testing the modules and their functionality. 

## Cons of TDD
However, TDD also has its downsides. Firstly, it can be very time-consuming for developers. This is because along with developing new features, they also have to develop tests. This increases the time of the development cycles because of the added time required to develop the tests. Furthermore, the tests also require maintenance to function correctly. This is because every time the code is updated, whether it be new features, module updates, or requirement changes, the corresponding tests also have to be updated to reflecte the changes. Furthermore, the test cases that are written by the developers are usually just to test the basic functionality and the common test cases the developers can think of. They do not provide 100% test coverage because the tests created are limited to the developers' skills and thoughts and may result in edge test cases to not be tested.
